  <h3 align="center"> Hello, my name is Jevon Suharnoko. Here you will find my work on AP CSP and its projects</h3>
  <br>
  <p align= "justified">These are my collection of discoveries that I found during my AP CSP course in my senior year.
  I enjoy coding due to the logic and functions that is closely related to mathematical logic, such as Boolean expressions and functions.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p align = "justified"> Part of the reason that I took intrest in computer science is the mathematical logic and application within it, such in cryptography and patterns in coding.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> The best that I know of Mathematical application in programming is the field of ell</p>
