  <h3 align="left"> Hello, My name is Jevon Suharnoko. I love to create engineering crafts, do mathematics, and learn physics and chemistry. </h3>
  
<br>
<p>I enjoy learning but really hates video games. It seems to be my nature to conduct research or study something new.</p>

<p>Sometimes I also play chess and try to beat the next computer level. I love it because of the beautiful patterns and logic behind every chess moves and strategies.</p>

<p>To my friends, I am usually known to be a fast-paced and restless person. Mostly it is because of the challenges that I took gladly such as much harder courses or committing to a study of, say, SAT or Physics beyond what others are willing to do</p>
